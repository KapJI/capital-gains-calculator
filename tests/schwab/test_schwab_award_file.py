"""Test how --schwab-award-file routes each Schwab Equity Awards export.

Schwab states an Equity Awards account in more than one layout, and the option
takes any of them: the award-price CSV that prices vests listed in the main
history, and the complete transaction history as JSON or as CSV. Which one a
file holds is read from its contents, so these tests care about the contents
and deliberately not about the extension.
