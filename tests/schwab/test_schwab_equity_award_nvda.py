"""NVIDIA-specific parsing of Schwab Equity Award JSON exports.

Schwab reports NVDA history in mixed units. Acquisitions are restated for later
splits, disposals are not, and one record type mixes both inside itself. Each
test here pins one of those rules.

The fixture is a synthetic portfolio: real dates and real prices, invented
share counts. Real dates and prices because they are what is under test — the
split boundaries of 20 July 2021 and 10 June 2024, and the tax year end.
