"""Test Schwab Cancel Buy filtering logic.

Tests the filtering of Cancel Buy transactions and their matching with original
Buy transactions within the search window.

Cancel Buy is a Schwab-specific transaction type that indicates a purchase was
cancelled. Both rows have to be filtered out to avoid counting a purchase that
never stood. The cancellation carries ActionType.CANCEL_BUY rather than the
type of a purchase, so a row that escapes the filter is refused downstream
instead of being booked as an acquisition.

Real Schwab exports are ordered newest-first (see
tests/schwab/data/schwab_transactions.csv, where 2021 rows appear before 2020
rows). Since a Cancel Buy is chronologically *after* the Buy it cancels, in a
newest-first CSV the Cancel Buy row appears *above* (before) its matching Buy
row. All CSVs below follow that realistic ordering.
