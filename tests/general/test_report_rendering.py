"""The rendered report shows each disposal's figures on one basis.

Every figure in the PDF is the exact amount rounded to the penny on its own,
so a line can be out by a penny against its own components; that bound is
arithmetic, not a defect. What must not happen is a line out by the fee: the
proceeds shown net of the sale fee beside an allowable cost that already
includes it. The figures are parsed back out of the LaTeX source, so the
check covers what the reader sees rather than the values behind it.
