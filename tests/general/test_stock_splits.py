"""Share reorganisations: stock splits and share consolidations.

A reorganisation is not a disposal and not an acquisition. The old holding
and the new one are the same asset, held continuously, at the same allowable
cost (TCGA 1992 ss126-127, HMRC CG51805). Only the number of units changes,
so every test here checks both: that the count follows the event, and that
the pooled cost does not move.
