# Trading 212

cgt-calc reads the CSV account history exported by Trading 212. Give it a directory rather than a
single file because a complete account history may require several exports.

Export the Invest account only. Do not include ISA activity: income and capital gains from
[investments in an ISA do not need to be declared](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts/how-isas-work).
If you also export the ISA for your own records, keep it in a separate directory. The CSV does not
identify the account type, so cgt-calc cannot separate the accounts later.

## Export your account history

1. In Trading 212, open **Menu**, then **History**.
2. Select the export button.
3. Choose the date range. Exporting the history since the account was opened is the safest option;
    see [Before you start](../usage.md#before-you-start) for why earlier transactions may be needed.
4. Select every available data category so that orders, cash transactions, dividends and interest
    are included.
5. Download the CSV file.
6. If your complete history requires multiple exports, repeat the process with consecutive date
    ranges, making sure there are no gaps.

The official
[Trading 212 export instructions](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016898917-Can-I-export-the-trading-data-from-my-account)
show the current controls. Use the account-history export, not a PDF statement or the separate pie
export.

## Prepare the directory

Put the CSV files directly in one directory, for example:

```text
trading212/
├── from_2022-04-06_to_2023-04-05.csv
├── from_2023-04-06_to_2024-04-05.csv
└── from_2024-04-06_to_2025-04-05.csv
```

The base filenames do not matter. cgt-calc reads every CSV file directly inside the directory, but
it does not search subdirectories. Do not add unrelated CSV files, and make sure there are no gaps
between date ranges. Matching transactions in overlapping files are reconciled using their recorded
contents and the number of copies in each export. For ordinary transactions, cgt-calc ignores
fractional seconds when matching overlapping files, so older exports without milliseconds still
match newer ones. Reorganisation rows use their exact times, because those times are needed to
validate the event. IDs help distinguish otherwise identical fills, but are not treated as globally
unique because Trading 212 can reuse one ID for different transactions. If overlapping files
represent one split in both the older one-row form and the newer open/close form, cgt-calc refuses
rather than risk applying it twice; replace them with one complete export covering the named dates.

One overlap cannot be reconciled: if two exports give the same transaction different IDs, cgt-calc
reads them as two separate fills and counts both. Reorganisation rows are refused rather than
doubled when that happens, but an ordinary trade is not, so check the final portfolio against
Trading 212 if you keep overlapping exports.

## Generate the report

For the 2024/25 tax year, run:

```shell
cgt-calc --year 2024 --trading212-dir trading212/
```

`--year 2024` means 6 April 2024 to 5 April 2025. Follow [Generate and Review a Report](../usage.md)
to find and check the output.

### Stock splits and share consolidations

Trading 212 exports a share reorganisation as two rows: `Stock split close` states your complete
position before it and `Stock split open` states your complete position after it. Both are needed,
and cgt-calc combines them into one event. They can be written in either order, and they can fall in
different exports, which is why the whole directory is read before they are paired.

Forward splits and consolidations are both supported, including fractional holdings and ratios that
are not whole numbers. The event is not a sale or a purchase: no money moves, no gain or loss
arises, and the pooled cost is unchanged. Only the number of units changes, so a later disposal
takes a different share of the same cost
([TCGA 1992 s127](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/12/part/IV/chapter/II),
[CG51805](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/capital-gains-manual/cg51805)). The report shows
the event on its own, with the counts either side and the ratio.

The `Total`, `Price / share` and `Exchange rate` columns on those rows are checked against each
other and against the counts, and are not read as proceeds or as a new cost. Both currency columns
have to be filled in: a price with no stated currency cannot be checked against a total, and an
exchange rate does not supply the missing name. A row that states a result, a fee, a tax or a cash
movement is refused: a consolidation that pays cash may be a part disposal rather than a
reorganisation, and that is not the same calculation.

Every original split row is checked before overlapping copies are removed. If a half is missing, if
two halves cannot be matched one to one, or if the two rows disagree about the ticker, identifier,
currencies, time or value of the position, cgt-calc stops and names the rows, fields and values.
Check those rows against Trading 212 and replace partial files with one complete export covering the
event date.

### Dates and time zones

Trading 212 timestamps every transaction in UTC. cgt-calc converts each one to UK time, GMT in
winter and BST in summer, before taking the date. The tax year boundary and the same-day and 30-day
matching rules all run on UK calendar days, and the boundary always falls inside BST, so a
transaction stamped after 23:00 UTC on 5 April belongs to the following tax year.

### Known limitations

- Dividends are recorded at the CSV `Total`, which is net of withholding tax. The `Withholding tax`
    column is only used to check the export for consistency and does not appear separately in the
    report.
- Share transfers between accounts or brokers, labelled `Transfer in` or `Transfer out`, are not
    supported.
- One run covers one Trading 212 account. `--trading212-dir` takes a single directory and every file
    in it is read as one account, because nothing in the CSV identifies which account a row belongs
    to. If you hold the same security in two Trading 212 accounts, their exports cannot be combined
    in one run: a reorganisation of that security appears twice, and cgt-calc refuses rather than
    guess which half belongs to which account.
- A reorganisation cgt-calc cannot pair is refused while the CSV is read, which is before the
    calculator assembles the day. A RAW `STOCK_SPLIT` row, which overrides an unprovable
    reorganisation from any other input, therefore cannot override this one.
- The same reorganisation reported by two brokers cannot be told from two separate events, so
    cgt-calc refuses a day with more than one for the same security.
- A known ticker alias is supported because cgt-calc applies its `TICKER_RENAMES` mapping before
    pairing. For example, both `FB` and `META` are treated as `META`; an unknown ticker change is
    refused.
- A genuine ISIN change is always refused: if both halves state an ISIN and the values differ,
    cgt-calc will not pair them. Moving a holding between two different securities needs
    relationship data the export does not carry.
- A reorganisation of a very small holding can leave the ratio unrecoverable, because the exported
    counts are rounded. cgt-calc still calculates it exactly when your whole holding is the one the
    export describes; otherwise it stops rather than guess the ratio. Ratios beyond about 1,000 to 1
    are outside the range it searches, and one of those applied to a holding of around a
    hundred-thousandth of a share is a narrow edge case where the nearest ratio within range may be
    used instead of the event being reported as unrecoverable.
- A trade of the same security stamped between the two halves of a reorganisation is refused: there
    is no telling whether its count is in the units before it or after it. The same applies to a
    same-day trade from another input that carries no comparable time.
- A consolidation paid for partly in cash needs checking by hand. Where the cash is a return of
    value rather than income it is a capital distribution, and the event is a part disposal
    ([TCGA 1992 s122](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/12/section/122)) rather than a
    cost-preserving reorganisation. Trading 212 labels such a payment `Dividend` or an adjustment,
    which parses cleanly, so nothing here will notice.
- Share distributions, labelled `Stock distribution` or `Custom stock distribution`, are not
    supported. A distribution alongside a consolidation is usually a company separation, where the
    pooled cost has to be apportioned between the two resulting holdings by market value rather than
    preserved whole.
- The
    [export for a Trading 212 contract for difference account](https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/36243765206301-How-to-export-the-trading-data-from-my-CFD-account)
    uses a different, record-based CSV format that this parser does not support.

Do not delete an unsupported transaction from the export to make the calculation run. The missing
activity could make the resulting holdings and gains incorrect.

## Troubleshooting

### `Unknown column(s)` or `Unknown action`

Trading 212 occasionally changes its export format. First, upgrade cgt-calc using the same method
you used to install it and try again. If the error remains, open a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/cgt-calc/capital-gains-calculator/issues/new) containing:

- your cgt-calc version from `cgt-calc --version`;
- the complete error message;
- the CSV header for an unknown column; or
- a sanitised failing row for an unknown action.

Do not upload an unredacted account export: it can contain transaction IDs and other financial
information.

### A transaction is described differently by two exports

Two exports give the same Trading 212 transaction ID for what looks like the same transaction, at
the same second and for the same action, but they disagree about its details. That normally means
one export was taken after Trading 212 restated the transaction, for example after correcting a fee.

cgt-calc cannot tell which version is right, so it keeps both. Your totals may therefore count that
transaction twice. Re-export the overlapping period so that every file describes it the same way,
replace the older file, and run the calculation again.

### A same-second warning about identical transactions appears

cgt-calc found an unusually large group of otherwise identical transactions within one second. It
kept the correct number, so the totals are unchanged.

Check that the rows in the named files are genuine. If they are, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/cgt-calc/capital-gains-calculator/issues/new); otherwise replace
the affected exports with a fresh one.

### No transactions are detected

Check that the directory contains CSV files directly, rather than inside another directory. The file
extension is matched case-insensitively, so `.csv`, `.CSV` and mixed-case variants all work. Also
check that you passed the directory itself to `--trading212-dir`, not the path to one CSV file.

### The balance or portfolio looks wrong

Re-export the history with all data categories selected. Check for a missing date range, files from
the wrong account, or an unsupported action listed above.

### A price-per-share warning appears

Review transactions where the price multiplied by the quantity, after currency conversion and fees,
does not match the total shown in the CSV. cgt-calc continues after this warning, so resolve the
discrepancy against the transaction in Trading 212 before relying on the report.
