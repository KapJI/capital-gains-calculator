# Providing Custom ERI Data

Use a custom file only when the [bundled data](offshore-funds.md#bundled-data) does not cover the
exact ISIN and every reporting period you need.

## ERI_RAW format

Create a CSV with this exact header and one row for each share class and reporting period:

```csv
ISIN,Fund Reporting Period End Date,Currency,Excess of reporting income over distribution
IE00B42WWV65,30/06/2024,GBP,0.0066
```

The row is only an example of the format. Replace it with values from the fund's report:

- **ISIN:** the ISIN for the exact share class
- **Fund Reporting Period End Date:** the period end date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
- **Currency:** the three-letter currency code shown in the report
- **Excess of reporting income over distribution:** the ERI amount per unit, without multiplying it
    by the number of units you held

Keep the four column names unchanged and do not add other columns.

Add `--eri-raw-file` to your normal cgt-calc command. For example, with a Schwab transaction file:

```shell
cgt-calc --year 2024 --schwab-file schwab_transactions.csv --eri-raw-file eri_raw.csv
```
