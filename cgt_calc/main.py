        Doc basing on SOLV spin off out of MMM.

        # 1. Determine the Cost Basis (Acquisition Cost) of the SOLV Shares
        In the UK, the cost basis (or acquisition cost) of the new SOLV shares
        received from the spin-off needs to be determined. This is usually done
        by apportioning part of the original cost basis of the MMM shares to
        the new SOLV shares based on their market values at the time of the
        spin-off.

        ## Step-by-Step Allocation
        * Find the Market Values:

        Determine the market value of MMM shares and SOLV shares immediately
        after the spin-off.

        * Calculate the Apportionment:

        Divide the market value of the MMM shares by the total market value of
        both MMM and SOLV shares to find the percentage allocated to MMM.
        Do the same for SOLV shares to find the percentage allocated to SOLV.

        * Allocate the Original Cost Basis:

        Multiply the original cost basis of your MMM shares by the respective
        percentages to allocate the cost basis between the MMM and SOLV shares.

        ## Example Allocation
        * Original Investment:

        Assume you bought 100 shares of MMM at £100 per share, so your total
        cost basis is £10,000.

        * Market Values Post Spin-off:

        Assume the market value of MMM shares is £90 per share and SOLV shares
        is £10 per share immediately after the spin-off.
        The total market value is £90 + £10 = £100.

        * Allocation Percentages:

        Percentage allocated to MMM: 90/100 = 90%
        Percentage allocated to SOLV: 10/100 = 10%

        * Allocate Cost Basis:

        Cost basis of MMM: £10,000 * 0.90 = £9,000
        Cost basis of SOLV: £10,000 * 0.10 = £1,000

        # 2. Determine the Holding Period
        The holding period for the SOLV shares typically includes the holding
        period of the original MMM shares. This means the date you acquired the
        MMM shares will be used as the acquisition date for the SOLV shares.

        UK has a specific tax regime which applies to UK investors in offshore
        funds.

        https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/offshore-funds-self-assessment-helpsheet-hs265/hs265-offshore-funds

        Example of UK offshore funds are the most common UCITS ETFs (Vanguard,
        Blackrock, XTrackers) that are normally located in Ireland.

        When those funds are "reporting" funds, that is, enlisted in HMRC
        official list of reporting funds:
        https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/offshore-funds-list-of-reporting-funds
        We need to declare the excess income periodically (yearly) from these
        funds.

        Excess Reported Income (ERI) is all the income reported by the fund
        not distributed to you (normally through dividends).
        Note that both Accumulating and Distributing funds can have reportable
        income and require reporting.

        The ERI is calculated based on the number shares owned at the end of
        the fund end reporting day for each fund.
        You multiply number of shares times the Reportable income amount per
        share as reported by each fund.

        Fund reports are directly provided in the fund website (i.e. Blackrock,
        Vanguard, XTrackers, etc) on a yearly fashion.

        The ERI has two consequences:

        1) It increases your share cost basis at the time it materializes.
        2) It represents taxable income (either as dividend or interest
           depending on the fund type) at a future date, exactly 6 calendar
           months since the reporting day.

        Note that ERI also takes into account Bed and Breakfast so you're due
        ERI even if you sell before the reporting day and buy within 30 days.
        See https://www.rawknowledge.ltd/eri-explained-four-tricky-questions-answered/

        For some calculation example beside HMRC website you can use Vanguard
        FAQ:
        https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/content/dam/intl/uk-retail-direct/general/uk-reporting-fund-faq.pdf

        Note that the current implementation doesn't take into account
        equalisation strategy which is an optional fund reporting feature that
        allows for pro rata reporting when you buy the fund shares within a
        reporting period.
