"""Share reorganisations: stock splits and share consolidations.

The old holding is not disposed of and the new one is not acquired: the two
are the same asset, held continuously, with the same acquisition dates and
the same allowable cost (TCGA 1992 ss126-127, HMRC CG51805). Only the unit
count changes, so the pooled cost is never multiplied, divided or rounded
here and everything in this module is about the share count.
