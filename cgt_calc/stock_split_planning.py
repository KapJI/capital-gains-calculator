    broker's own books, and its own counts are what the ratio comes from, so
    a row outside that bracket is placed against a figure the broker stated.
    An export that posts the event as one row states only when it booked the
    entry: everything after it is in the new units, because the holding had
    already been restated when the row was written, but a row before it may
    have traded in either unit system - the market restates at the opening of
    the ex-date, and nothing says the broker's book-keeping ran to the same
    clock. Guessing there would not merely misplace that row: a single row
    states a net change, so `before_quantity` is whatever was placed ahead of
