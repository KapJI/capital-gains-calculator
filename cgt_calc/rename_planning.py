"""First pass: reading a day's ticker renames as one holding.

A ticker change leaves the same shares under another name. Same-date broker
rows do not consistently establish where the rename falls relative to trades,
so ordinary purchases and sales are checked against the whole holding.

The provisional pool still moves at the RENAME row. Day-open planning computes
capacity across the connected tickers; day-close reconciliation gathers any
remaining positions under the closing ticker. Acquisition and disposal logs
keep the ticker from the source row for the matching pass.

Other holding actions keep their existing processing because they may depend
on the pool's position or cost when processed.
