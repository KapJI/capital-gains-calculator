        than read from `dataclasses.fields`, so that adding a field to the
        model cannot silently change what counts as the same transaction.

        The timestamp is truncated to a whole second. Older exports state
        seconds and newer ones milliseconds, so comparing the stated instant
        would keep both copies of every row in an overlap that spans that
        change. Comparing the aware UTC value is also what lets the `Time`
        and `Time (UTC)` columns meet. `date` derives from the same value, so
        it needs no entry of its own.

        The ID is deliberately absent: Trading 212 reuses one ID across a buy
        and the sell that closes it, so an ID tells rows apart within a group
        rather than forming one.

        So are `price_foreign`, `currency_foreign`, `exchange_rate` and
        `notes`. Nothing outside this module reads them, and the price check
        that does runs at parse time, so whichever copy of a row survives,
        the calculation sees the same values. Keeping them would instead
        block a merge whenever two exports differ only in presentation.
