"""Standard equity-option support for Charles Schwab exports.

Schwab exports an option lifecycle as separate rows: the grant, then whatever
ended it, and for an assignment a stock row of its own posted on settlement.
UK tax treats the grant as the disposal (TCGA 1992 s144), so the rows have to
be reconciled into what actually happened before the calculator sees them.
That is all this module does; `schwab.py` reads the CSV and calls
`reconcile_written_options` once per declared account.
