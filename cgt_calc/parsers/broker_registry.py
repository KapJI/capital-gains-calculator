    A broker export can list the sale of vested shares before the vest itself

    against the current holding as soon as it is read, so the unsorted order
    fails with "Tried to sell not owned symbol". Vesting (``STOCK_ACTIVITY``)
    does not move the cash balance, so ordering it first cannot introduce a
    negative balance.

    Shares received from a spouse are written by hand too, and like a vest
    they cost nothing in cash, so they go first as well.

    Transfers to a spouse and gifts go last for the same reason from the
    other end. They are recorded by hand in a RAW file while the shares they
    move were acquired through a broker export, and parsers are merged in
    registry order, so such a row would otherwise be validated before the
    same-day acquisition that makes it possible. No consideration changes
    hands, so ordering them last cannot introduce a negative balance either.

    Everything else keeps its relative order, so the "buys last" ordering that
    some parsers rely on to avoid negative balances is preserved.
