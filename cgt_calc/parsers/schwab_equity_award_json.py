"""Charles Schwab Equity Award JSON export parser.

To get the data from Schwab:
1. Open https://client.schwab.com/app/accounts/history/#/
2. Make sure Equity Award Center is selected
3. Select date range 'Previous 4 Years' and click SEARCH
4. At the top right, click on Export and select type JSON
5. If you have had Equity Awards for more than 4 years, good news:
   Schwab now allows you to export all the data history (which you do need
   to calculate the CGT). In that case:
   * repeat the process to export older data
   * manually combine the data into a single file
