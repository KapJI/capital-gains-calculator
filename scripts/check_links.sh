# Check the links in all Markdown files with lychee.
#
# Two passes are run, the offline one first:
#   offline  - local files and heading anchors only. No network, so it is
#              deterministic and only fails on genuine mistakes in the change.
#   external - everything, including third party sites. Can fail for reasons
#              unrelated to the change under review.
#
# Shared settings live in lychee.toml. The remap resolves cgt-calc.uk URLs
# against the local docs sources, so a link to a page added in the same change
# is checked before the site is deployed. lychee requires an absolute file://
# target for a remap, hence the interpolation of the repository root below.
#
# The offline pass also reads the package sources, where the error messages
# print documentation URLs. lychee treats any file it does not recognise as
# plain text, so those are found in strings and comments alike, but only when
# a URL is written contiguously: a literal split across two lines ends at the
# closing quote and loses its anchor. Remote URLs in the sources are excluded
# by --offline, so this pass stays deterministic.
#
# Usage: scripts/check_links.sh [offline|external]
