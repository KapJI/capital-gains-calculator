[![CI](https://github.com/KapJI/capital-gains-calculator/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KapJI/capital-gains-calculator/actions)
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cgt-calc)](https://pypi.org/project/cgt-calc/)

Calculate capital gains tax by transaction history exported from Charles Schwab, Trading 212 and Morgan Stanley. Generate PDF report with calculations.

Automatically convert all prices to GBP and apply HMRC rules to calculate capital gains tax: "same day" rule, "bed and breakfast" rule, section 104 holding.

## Report example

[calculations_example.pdf](https://github.com/KapJI/capital-gains-calculator/blob/main/calculations_example.pdf)

## Installation

Install it with [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) (or regular pip):

```shell
pipx install cgt-calc
```

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or above.
-   `pdflatex` is required to generate the report.

## Install LaTeX

### MacOS

```shell
brew install --cask mactex-no-gui
```

### Debian based

```shell
apt install texlive-latex-base
```

### Windows

[Install MiKTeX.](https://miktex.org/download)

## Usage

You will need several input files:

-   Exported transaction history from Schwab in CSV format since the beginning.
    Or at least since you first acquired the shares, which you were holding during the tax year.
    [See example](https://github.com/KapJI/capital-gains-calculator/blob/main/tests/test_data/schwab_transactions.csv).
-   Exported transaction history from Trading 212.
    You can use several files here since Trading 212 limit the statements to 1 year periods.
    [See example](https://github.com/KapJI/capital-gains-calculator/tree/main/tests/test_data/trading212).
-   Exported transaction history from Morgan Stanley.
    Since Morgan Stanley generates multiple files in a single report, please specify a directory produced from the report download page.
-   CSV file with initial stock prices in USD at the moment of vesting, split, etc.
    [`initial_prices.csv`](https://github.com/KapJI/capital-gains-calculator/blob/main/cgt_calc/resources/initial_prices.csv) comes pre-packaged, you need to use the same format.
-   (Optional) Monthly GBP/USD prices from [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/exchange-rates-for-customs-and-vat).
    [`GBP_USD_monthly_history.csv`](https://github.com/KapJI/capital-gains-calculator/blob/main/cgt_calc/resources/GBP_USD_monthly_history.csv) comes pre-packaged, you need to use the same format if you want to override it.

Then run (you can omit the brokers you don't use):

```shell
cgt-calc --year 2020 --schwab schwab_transactions.csv --trading212 trading212/ --mssb mmsb_report/
```

See `cgt-calc --help` for the full list of settings.

## Contribute

All contributions are highly welcomed.
If you notice any bugs please open an issue or send a PR to fix it.

Feel free to add new parsers to support transaction history from more brokers.

## Testing

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing dependencies.

-   For local testing you need to [install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
-   After that run `poetry install` to install all dependencies.
-   Then activate `pre-commit` hook: `poetry run pre-commit install`

You can also run all linters and tests manually with this command:

```shell
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```
